# Project

Run virtual environment. From the source directory (4YP) run:

```bash
project/Scripts/activate
```

Then you can install packages via `pip`

To create the requirements.txt:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Add files to the base directory - not into the project folder.

## Created venv via

python3 -m venv /project
```
